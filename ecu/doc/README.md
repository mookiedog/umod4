# ECU Documentation

The HC11G5 documentation in this directory is stored as part of this project mainly for convenience.

Specifically, the original Motorola documentation was very difficult to find, or at least it was back in the day.
It contains the timing diagrams used to develop the umod4 hardware and software.
